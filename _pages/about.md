  I am a researcher and Ph.D. student working in the general area of Artificial Intelligence, lately with Large Language Models (LLMs). I am part of the [Machine Teaching Group](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/) at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), where we mainly focus our reasearch on AI-driven Education, under the supervision of [Dr. Adish Singla](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html). 
  
  I am fascinated by the newest advancements in AI. Currently, I am interested in leveraging generative models for enhancing and personalizing education. Our latest projects involve exercise generation and validation using LLMs and benchmarking their computational thinking capabilities.

  I have previously worker as a Data Scientist for a startup.
